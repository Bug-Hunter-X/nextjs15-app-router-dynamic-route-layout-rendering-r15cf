# Next.js 15 App Router: Intermittent Rendering Failures

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes in conjunction with nested layouts.  The issue results in intermittent rendering failures, where pages display blank screens or show incorrect content.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to different dynamic routes.  You'll observe inconsistent rendering behavior.

## Potential Causes

The root cause is currently under investigation, but it might relate to issues with route matching, data fetching, or component lifecycle management within the App Router's new architecture.

## Workarounds

The solution file provides a potential workaround, which may help in some cases, although a comprehensive solution is required.

## Note

This is a simplified reproduction of a complex issue. The actual behavior might vary slightly depending on your project's specific setup and dependencies.
